title: Week 0 - Overview

Over the next few weeks we will be attempting to create an audio visualizer. The audio visualizer will consist of several individual hexagonal panels. These hexagonal panels will have LEDs in them and be individually controlled by an external micro-controller. The micro-controller will be determining an animation to match music playing at the time. This animation determination will be done in real-time.
