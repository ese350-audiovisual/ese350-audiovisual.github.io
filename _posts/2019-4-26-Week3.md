title: Week 3 - Multiple Panels
---

## Goal for the Week:
* Control a single LED panel in sync with music

### Hardware/Mechanical Work:
For the electrical part, this week we wired up ATTINY45s to be slave boards to take in signals from an Mbed and output signals to the LED strips. For each panel, we set up an ATTINY in the bottom layer and soldered the circuit on a perfboard. For the mechanical part, we replaced the smoke acrylic with raster etched clear acrylic in an attempt to diffuse the light from the LED strips into a larger portion of the top of the hexagonal panel. This did not work quite as well as we had hoped, but is definitely an improvement from the smoke acrylic we were previously using. In general, we tried to modularize the system so we duplicated 5 panels with our new design and wired them together, which required a lot of laser cutting and soldering.


### Software Work:
We first wrote the code so that an Mbed could drive the LED strips. This required communicating with the LED strips using a bit banging protocol. Once we were able to control the LED strips, we determined that we would want two Mbeds, one to take in the audio signal and determine the visual output (the main Mbed), and one to change the color of the LED strip (the slave Mbed). To do this, we wrote a communication protocol for the main Mbed to tell the slave Mbed what color to set the LED strip. This communication protocol was a similar bit banging protocol to the one used to drive the LED strip.

## Results from this Week:
The result from this week was that we had a single fully operational panel which could light up in time with music. To demonstrate this result we have a video of the panel lighting up to the base in the song "Sail" by Awolnation:
